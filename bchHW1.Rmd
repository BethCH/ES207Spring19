> x<-c(1,2,4)
> x[4]
# result = [1] NA because there is no 4th value

#question 2.
> q <- c(x,x,8)
# Try creating a variable "s" that is the standard deviation of q
> s <- sd(q)
# > s
# [1] 2.478479

# question 3.
# Can you make R write your name?
> paste( "Beth" , "Clifton" , "Holcomb")

> paste("Beth Clifton Holcomb")

# question 4.
# What objects are left in your R session after removing m?

# > ls()
# [1] "a" "b" "c" "d" "m" "q" "s" "x" "y"
# > rm (m)
# > rm(m)

# In rm(m) : object 'm' not found
> ls()

# this function counts the number of odd numbers in a vector. in the case of c(1,3,5) there are 3 as seen in the result [1] 3 . in the last vector: c(1,2,3,7,9), there were 4 displayed in the result [1] 4

# question 6.
# Try creating a new function 'evencount' that counts the even numbers in a vector.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
